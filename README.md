# Tim Robinson's Portfolio
This is my portfolio outlining information about me and showcasing some of my work.

## Motivation
For this portfolio, I wanted to create a site where I could showcase some of my work while ensuring that it is accessible on any screen be it a computer monitor, a phone, or even a television.
